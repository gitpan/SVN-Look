Revision history for SVN-Look. -*- text -*-

0.09	2008-09-27
	Removed dependency from Switch.pm.

	Look for the svnlook command in a bunch of directories.

	Now the module can be built without the svn commands but the
	tests will check this and be skipped.

	Added tests: t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t

	Private functions got the _ prefix to avoid complaints from
	pod-coverage.t. 

0.08    2008-09-25/23:00:00
        First version released independently of SVN::Hooks.
